          I'm a Unity3D developer with over 8 years of experience creating games, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) applications across multiple platformsâ€”including PC, Android, iOS, and Samsung Gear VR.
          I specialize in building engaging, high-quality interactive experiences using Unity3D and C#. I also have hands-on experience with tools like Blender and GIMP for 3D modeling and asset creation.
          I'm committed to delivering results that meet (and often exceed) client expectations. My work ethic is grounded in clear communication, attention to detail, and a strong focus on creating polished, reliable products.
